# Anki

there should be 1 button to open anki modal, inside of anki game there should be 2 button groups: 1 group - 3 buttons "en db", "km", "ru", 2 group "description -> word" or "word -> description"

therefore 6 modes:

1. "you are shown khmer db - list is a Word (khmer word) - you try to guess translation (en or ru) (in your mind)"
2. "you are shown khmer db - list is a Desc (en or ru) fields where khmer text is removed - you try to guess Word (km) (there is also "fill in blank" that will show diff on reveal, filled optionally)"

3. "you are shown en db - list is a Word (en word) - you try to guess translation (km) (in your mind)"
4. "you are shown en db - list is a Desc (en) fields where non-khmer text is removed - you try to guess Word (there is also "fill in blank" that will show diff on reveal, filled optionally)"

5. "you are shown ru db - list is a Word (ru word) - you try to guess translation (km) (in your mind)"
6. "you are shown ru db - list is a Desc (ru) fields where non-khmer text is removed - you try to guess Word (there is also "fill in blank" that will show diff on reveal, filled optionally)"
